=head1 NAME

App::CPRReporter - Application to merge various datasets info an overview of who followed CPR training (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the use of rescue breathing and chest compressions to help a person whose breathing and heartbeat have stopped)

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $object = App::CPRReporter->new(parameter => 'text.txt');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This application parses various datasets and fuses the information to generate an overview of
who followed the theoretical part and the practical part of a course on CPR (cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, the use of rescue breathing and chest compressions to help a person whose
breathing and heartbeat have stopped).

More specifically, this application was written to take into account the following information:

=over

=item An Excel document of the employee database, containing familyname (column C), given name (column D) and group (column A)

=item An XML document extracted from the training station software (see Text::ResusciAnneparser)

=item An Ecxel document of the people who followed training, containing familyname (column B), given name (column D) and course date (column H)

=back

This application solves two problems, firstly it automates the task of generating an overview of what people in what group already followed training and who not.
Secondly, the application also automates name resolving. The two Excel documents are generated by the personel department and hence should have to correct
names. However, the XML document is filled with user-typed input. Hence the name matching between all datasets needs do be done taking into account typos, inverse input, shortened names, ...

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new(%parameters)>

This constructor returns a new App::CPRReporter object. Supported parameters are listed below

=over

=item employees

The filename of the Excel document (Office 2007 format) with a full list of people that should follow the course.

=item certificates

The filename of the XML document extracted from the training software.

=item course

The filename of the Excel document (Office 2007 format) with an overview of people that followed the theoretical trainging.

=back

=head2 C<run()>

Run the application and print out the result.

=head2 BUILD

Helper function to run custome code after the object has been created by Moose.

=head1 TODO

Currently, the application prints output to STDOUT in a CSV format. Future versions could write to Excel immediately.
